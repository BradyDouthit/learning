# Performance
Taking some time to get a better handle on performance by comparing languages and common techniques to speed up algorithms. While not a perfect analog for the real world (since it is lacking real complexity), each script will read in a text file and calculate the word frequency. The text file is not in this repo because it would be too big but any text file will do.

I write a lot of JS so I start there writing the algorithm in a way that is most reasonable to a person, rather than focusing on performance. From there I simply iterate to make it faster. Each step is a new script.
