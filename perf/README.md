# Performance
Taking some time to get a better handle on performance by comparing languages and common techniques to speed up algorithms.

I write a lot of JS so I start there writing the algorithm in a way that is most reasonable to a person, rather than focusing on performance. From there I simply iterate to make it faster. Each step is a new script.
